A
Umm... Where am I?
A
My head....
B
Hey, are you awake?              Got a strange dream, right?
A
Yeah, it seems like I dreamt of a battle and a castle.
B
Dreams can be confusing sometimes. I'm Aber.
B
I'm not sure about the castle, but... I have a sister in a nearby mine. Maybe you can ask her.
A
Alright, I'll go and ask.
B
Judging by your attire,            are you a hunter?
A
I've forgotten everything else. Ugh, my head...
A
......
A
I'm fine.
B
Lately, the witch in the forest has been capturing people to offer. 
B
muttering something about 'everything will come to pass on the night of the full moon.'
B
My other sister was taken not long ago. If you can, could you help me find her?
A
A witch? I'll do my best,        don't worry.
B
Thank you.                              Be careful on the way.
B
If you need any help,           come back to me anytime.
